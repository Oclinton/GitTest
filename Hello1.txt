Hello, from Omar.

So with thought, you can collapse a wave function. Now this energy is material, 
destroying all other potential realities. It now has to interact with the physical 
world, and has to follow the rules of the system. That's why we cant manifest 
things out of thin air. However it can affect neurotransmitter release. Which affect 
nerve impulses. Ok, So we are taking in quantum
energy by collapsing wave functions? Is that the fuel for consciousness?
